# Recipes Wiki

This is a simple wiki app for creating and editing recipes.

## Approach

This app uses Devise to handle user registrations and sessions. It also uses Pundit to allow only signed-in users to create, update, and delete recipes.

## Collaborators

Both the Devise and Pundit readmes proved to be helpful in installing and configuring each gem.
